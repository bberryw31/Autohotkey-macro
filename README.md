# Autohotkey-macro

## Project Description
This repository contains a diverse collection of automation scripts developed using AutoHotkey (AHK), a powerful scripting language for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting. Spanning from 2019 to the present, these projects demonstrate my extensive experience and familiarity with AHK, accumulated through consistent usage over the years. The scripts automate various tasks, from repetitive actions in video games to complex GUI interactions for productivity and convenience. Each project reflects my ability to leverage AHK's capabilities to create efficient and effective automation solutions tailored to specific needs.

This automation script was created for the mobile tower defense game "33rd." It automates in-game actions such as mouse movements, clicks, and keypresses to streamline gameplay. The script updates logs with activity descriptions, ensuring transparency and ease of debugging.

#### airhouse ticket macro
This tool automates the process of managing ticket bookings on the Airhouse platform. It refreshes pages, tracks the number of refreshes, and sends notifications via Pushover. The integration of GUI elements for macro control demonstrates my capability to combine user-friendly interfaces with complex automation tasks.

#### autoclick
These scripts are designed for simple yet effective automation of mouse clicks. They simulate mouse clicks at randomized intervals, providing a hands-free solution for repetitive tasks in both gaming and productivity applications.

#### autoreboot
This script automates the system reboot process by waiting for a specified duration and then simulating a mouse click to initiate a reboot. It exemplifies the automation of system-level tasks, ensuring operations run smoothly without manual intervention.

#### count test
This utility script tracks and logs the runtime of automated tasks. Featuring a GUI with a list view for displaying timestamps and activity descriptions, it is ideal for monitoring and debugging long-running processes.

#### detection experiments
A versatile script for text manipulation and processing, it automates interactions with text fields and simulates keypresses to handle various text-related tasks. This script enhances productivity by automating routine text operations.

#### evil hunter tycoon autoraid
This macro automates raid management in the game "Evil Hunter Tycoon." It handles different raid states, updates logs, and controls the number of remaining raids through GUI interactions, improving efficiency and gameplay experience.

#### minecraft autojoin
This script maintains a player's presence in a Minecraft server by checking online status and re-joining the server if a crash is detected. It uses image recognition to ensure accurate status monitoring and maintain continuous online presence in multiplayer games.

#### srt ticket macro
These scripts automate the purchase of train tickets by simulating mouse clicks to navigate through the ticket booking interface. They streamline complex web interactions, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience during the booking process.
